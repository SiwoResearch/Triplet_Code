Significance
One of the most intriguing discoveries in biology is that the order of amino acids in each protein
is determined by the order of nucleotides (commonly represented by the letters A, U, G, C) in a
biological molecule known as RNA. The genetic code serves as a dictionary that maps each of
the 64 triplets ‘words’ in RNA to the 20 amino acids, thereby specifying how information encoded
in RNA is decoded into sequences of amino acids (i.e., proteins). The deciphering of the genetic
code was one of the greatest discoveries of the 20th century (1968 Nobel Prize in Medicine and
Physiology) and is central to modern molecular biology. Yet, how it came to be that the order of
triplets in RNA encodes the sequence of the protein synthesized remains one of the most
important enigmas of biology. Paradoxically, in all life forms proteins cannot be synthesized
without RNA and RNA itself cannot also be synthesized without proteins, presenting a chicken
and egg dilemma. By analyzing thousands of microbial genomes using approaches drawn from 
the field of natural language processing, this study finds that the order of triplets across genomes contains relics of an ancient triplet code, distinct from but closely connected to the genetic code.Unlike the genetic code which specifies the relationship between information in RNA and the
sequence of proteins, this ancient code describes the relationship between adjacent triplets in
extant genome sequences, whereby such triplets are often different from each other by a single
letter. Triplets that are closely related by this ancient code encode amino acids that are thought
to have emerged around the same period in the earth’s early history. In other words, a fossil
record of the chronological order of appearance of amino acids on early earth appears written in
genome sequences. This potentially demonstrates that the process by which RNA sequences
were synthesized in the primordial world relied on triplets and was coupled to amino acids
available at the time. Hence, the connections between primordial RNA synthesis and a primitive
mechanism for linking amino acids to form peptides could have enabled one type of molecule
(RNA) to code for the other (protein), facilitating the emergence of the genetic code.
